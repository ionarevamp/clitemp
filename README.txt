Using this tool requires an account on WeatherAPI.com (basic usage should be free).
Specifically you need a key for real-time weather data, and a file containing said key named 'WeatherAPI.key' in either the same directory as the project root (i.e. Cargo.toml location) when using `cargo run`, or the same directiry as the built binary when running it directly.

The name is a work-in-progress, and this is just a tool I made to quickly check the weather via command line.
